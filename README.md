# James-sServerWaitQueue
Like 2bored2wait but you can do it with your own server and may other ones!

# NOTE: this only works on windows ten and I will not make it for other OS.

# IMPORTANT! you must make sure that the target server and queue server is cracked or the proxy will not like it and may cause damage to the proxy or backended servers

# What is James's Server Wait queue (Short JSWQ)
JSWQ is a proxy made by me (like 2bored2wait) how it works is. 4b4t dosent have a queue right? and if the server is full you just have to wait for a player to leave and you maybe miss the turn, well thats why I made JamesServerWaitQueue this will: make a queue like 2b2t,checks if the main is full and connects you if there is a free player slot

Player -> Proxy -> hosted/remote queue -> checks if targeted server is full (must be cracked like 1b1e or 4b4t) -> queues the player/Sends the player to the targeted server!

# Setting it up

1. download the source.zip, start.bat and plugins.zip
2. unzip everything
3. make a new folder
4. unzip the plugin.zip,source.zip and start.bat to the new folder
5. go into the config.yml and go down and where it says servers:
6. change that ip 4b4t.live:25565 to your own server ip (eg. play.crackedserver.net)
7. save the config.yml
8. run the start.bat
9. stop the server and go into plugins then JSWQ and go into the config.yml
10. set the queue size limit and the main, A WARNING FOR THE TARGETED SERVER MAKE SURE YOU ARE SETTING IT TO THE TARGETED SERVER NOT THE PROXY.
11. go back to the proxy and run the start.bat
12. connect to the server using localhost or if you set a custom port do (eg. 24445,25561,25577)
# Make should the server version is 1.7.10-1.16.5
